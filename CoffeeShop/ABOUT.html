                The Black Cafe first opened its doors in July of 2008. The founder, Haden Bauer, wanted a coffee shop
                that offered a cool, laid-back aesthetic combined with the best damn coffee out there.
            </p><br />

            <p style="text-align:justify">
                Unfortunately, this kind of establishment didn't exist, so he decided to open one of his own. Located in the heart of Brooklyn, New York,
                The Black Cafe focuses on specialty drinks brewed from only the finest Brazilian coffee beans.

            <p style="text-align:justify">
                In addition to some amazing coffee, The Black Cafe also offers a wide range of vegan food options, so everyone can find
                something great to eat within their personal dietary needs.
